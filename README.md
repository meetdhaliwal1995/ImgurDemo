Android Studio will take a few moments to generate an APK file.

Once the APK build is complete, youâ€™ll receive a notification on the bottom right corner of your screen. From that notification, select <b>Locate</b> and you will be led to the APK file location.

If you miss the notification, you can still locate the APK file in the following path within your project folder: <b>app/build/outputs/apk/debug.</b> The file is named <b>app-debug.apk</b> by default.
